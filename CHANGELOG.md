## Upcoming

* Dropped scala 2.10 support

## v0.5.31 (2015-12-11)

* Added `deriveSingletonJSON` macros which provides a nice alternative to `Enumeration` where you can represent 
  enum-values as a sealed case object hierarchy (you can find an example in the [DeriveSingletonJSONSpec](https://github.com/sphereio/sphere-scala-libs/blob/master/json/src/test/scala/DeriveSingletonJSONSpec.scala)).
